Unix is good at handling many different of terminals

Terminal Handling



Control structures in Unix
CASE..ESAC
SELECT

stty - command showing an abbreviated list of terminal capablitities
stty -a
ex) it displays such as intr = ^C
If you want to change the usage of command you can simply change by doing following:
stty intr ^I
But it does not influence another terminal, which means although you have changed in one terminal and you open the new terminal with the same account, the new terminal does have the previouse set of stty list
stty -echo - disables echoing of typed characters 
ex)
echo -n "Enter password: "
stty -echo -이렇게 함으로써 입력하는 비밀번호가 콘솔에 보이지 않는다.
read password
stty echo
echo -e "\nYou entered '$password'"

echo $TERM - displays the name of terminal you are using.

infocmp
ex) cub - cursor back
cuf - cursor forward 

tput
ex) tput cols - give number of columns in current display
tput lines - give number of lines in current display


**need to remember
~/.profile
~/.bashrc
~/.bash_profile

case 
ex) case expression in
pattern1)
statements;;
pattern2)
statements;;
esac

If there is no match, exit status of case is zero

select - generates a menu from a list of items.
syntax)
select ITEM in [LIST]
