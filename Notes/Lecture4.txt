stdin(standard input), stdout, stderr

stdin - describes from where a command receives input
stdout - describes where a command sends it's output

command < filename

command > filename - redirects a command's standard output to a file

Pipes - represented by |
ex) ls -al | more

"Here" documents
<< symbol indicates a "here" document

ex) sort << EOF
word
name
car 
EOF

This example shows that the words between EOF...EOF is considered as input to sort command.
To put the input, you must use a EOF as start point.

Let's say I don't have a file name called nofile
and commanded cat nofile
and it will shows the error
and If I want to redirect the error to somewhere else instead of terminal
use the 2> or 2>>

usually 0 is stdin 1 is stdout, 2 is stderr
If I want to redirect both the outputand error use the >&

cat nofile 2> /dev/null
- as /dev/null is something like a blackhole so it will be showing nothing

It can be used in several ways
ex) find / -name "tempfile" 2> /dev/null
cat /dev/null > /.bashrc

tail and head

File descriptor (fd) - unique number assigning to file operator
In the Bash shell environment, every process has three opened by default.
input,display, and error ==0,1,2
These can be assigned to any input or output file.


ex) declaring output.txxt
exec fd > output.txt
exec 4 > output.txt

for closing the file
exec fd<&-


ex) exec 4 > file1 //declaring the exec 4 that it will be used to redirect the output to file1
ls >&4 //should not have blank after >
echo "Final" > &4
exec 4 >&- //&- tells unix, plz close the fd 4
cat file1

Output will be the list of the files and the last item will be the 'Final'

ex2)exec 5<file1
read line1 <&5 //read line1 from &5 which refers to a file1 containing the list of file
read line2 <&5 //make sure line1 and line2 are just a variables
echo 


exec 5<&-
read line2 <&5 // as the fd has closed, it cannot read anymore and will cause an error.

grep - it is used to grab specific items

ls -l | cut -d " " -f2 - It will get the second columns divided by the delimiter " "
wc -l feb6.txt | tee out1.txt - The number of lines of feb6.txt file and send the output to out1
