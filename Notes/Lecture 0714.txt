Modular Programming - emphasize separting the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable moduels
main idea is divide complex ones into smaller and combine these solutions.

long program can be divided into a smaller program called modules.

Programs are composed of one or more

Function
In Unix, when we call the function, we don't need to put () at the end 
ex) function() is written in function
The function must have return statement

Interesting point of function in bash is it only returns 0 for success, non-zero for failure.
It does not return value

Procedure
just executes commands and no return value

shebang - which shell is responsible for follwing code
It is optional but better to have
ex) #!/bin/sh
