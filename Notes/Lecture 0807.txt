Difference betweeen $name and ${name}

name=seneca
echo $name
echo $name.txt
echo $name+txt
echo ${name}_txt
echo "${name}_txt

echo removes the spaces and left no matter how many spaces you do have
ex)
name="seneca	college"

When you are assigning the value on the variable, you do not need any delimiter
However as soon as you do have assignment and command and another command after second command then it will consider the third command as argument of second command
And If you have command and then assignment to a variable then it won't work

set/unset
set - set a shell variable
ex) set value = 7

unset - delete a shell variable

<set command>
set -x : enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal


<seq command>
seq - output the number in vertical way
syntax)
seq [option] 


touch {a..c}{a..c}{a..c}
echo aa*
echo a{a,b}* - first character is a and second character is a or b and third character can be anything
//It works exactly the same as echo a[a,b]* echo a[ab]*

echo $_ : returns the last argument

sleep 30 & // run sleep timer 30 in background
echo $! // Process ID of the most recent command (or background command)
kill $! // kill Process ID of the most recent command (or background command)
